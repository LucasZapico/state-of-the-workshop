# State of the Workshop

# Objectives

## Public Objective

1. Showcase tools and workflows by year/quarter
2. Showcase a react website

## Interal Objectives

**Challenge**

I am often asked what tools or workflow I am using. The solution that I am going to build is a two part website. Part one is a internal component that will allow me to add tools, descriptions, links etc to a firebase db. This will then populate the public facing website.
